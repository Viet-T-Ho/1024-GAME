Project: 1024 Game with Board Class  
Oct, 2024 
Computer Science Student, UIC
  
- Developed an object-oriented version of the 1024/2048-like game in C++ 
  by creating a Board class to handle all aspects of the game state, 
  including tile movement, combining, and random number generation.
  
- Engineered the Board class with methods to initialize the board, 
  display the grid, process player input, and manage tile shifts and combinations.
    
- Implemented different levels of difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard), 
  where each difficulty has distinct random number generation probabilities 
  (50% for 2, 30% for 4 in Easy; 70% for 2, 30% for 4 in Medium).
    
- Designed a robust game loop that alternates between displaying the board, 
  accepting user input, and updating the game state with tile movements.

- Created an efficient system for determining valid moves and combinations by analyzing rows and columns, 
  ensuring that tiles only combine once per move and in the correct order.

- Utilized advanced C++ features such as dynamic memory allocation and class inheritance 
  to optimize the program and facilitate modular development.

- Tested the game for edge cases, such as handling full boards with no valid moves 
  and ensuring correct behavior during tile shifting and combining.
    
- Presented the final game with an emphasis on the use of object-oriented programming principles, 
  demonstrating my ability to structure complex systems and maintain code flexibility.
    
- Technical Skills: C++, Object-Oriented Programming, Board Class Design, Algorithm Optimization, 
  Dynamic Memory Allocation, Random Number Generation
